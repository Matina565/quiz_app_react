# 📘 Matina’s React Quiz Application

The React Quiz Application is an interactive and responsive quiz platform built using React.js.
It allows users to attempt multiple-choice quizzes with a countdown timer, live score updates, and an auto-submit feature when time expires.

This project helped me learn the core concepts of React such as components, state management, hooks, and API integration.
